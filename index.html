            <h2>Nickname: "Borges", "Careca"</h2>
            <p> My Name is Andr√©. I have few nicknames, but most people call me by my last name, Borges!</p>
            <p>What I love, most, about BUYI is the fact that it provides a good
                education and with spiritual focus. I can feel the necessity to learn,
                as part of a greater meaning. <br>
                I learn much better in face to face environment, because of my
                tight/unpredictable schedule, so online is a challenge for me. But, in
                BYUI, it is clear what is expected and by when, so it is less dificult
                to follow.
            </p>
            <p>I've been a member of the church since 1995, when I was 15. I served a
                mission in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for 2 years, got married in 2003,
                served as bishop for 6 years, and now I serve as member of stake high
                concil and Young men stake President.
            </p>
            <p>I have the most beautiful wife and children there is. My oldest son is 18 years 
                old and is going to serve a mission in Chile. <br>
                My oldest daugther is 17 and is talented in the Piano, and my youngest daugther 
                is 15 and she loves to sing and has a beautiful voice
            </p>
            <p>As a brazilian, I love playing soccer, Jiu-jitsu and voleyball, but I also enjoy
                reading and listening to music.
